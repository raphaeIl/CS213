This repository contains 5 group projects from the CS213 Fall 2022 semester
**Note:** All detailed descriptions of projects can be found in the pdf within each folder

## Main Concepts Learned

* Basic Java
* Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
* Exception Handling
* Design Patterns
* Class Diagrams
* Annotating Code and Creating Javadoc
* Unit Testing (JUnit)
* JavaFX (Project 3 & 4)
* Android App Development (Project 5)

### Project 1 - (FitnessCompany)
A simple command-line based software that is used by a fitness chain to manage gym memberships and fitness class schedules.
Just like a normal command-line program, this provides a console-based interactive user interface to process the operations in command lines and display the results.

### Project 2 - (FitnessCompany Extended)
Next phase of the software developed in Project 1, provides additional features such as more membership options, fitness class management, and a better command system.
Also includes Unit Tests using the JUnitTest API.

### Project 3 - (FitnessCompany GUI)
Same FitnessCompany Application from the previous projects but the user interface is revamped to a GUI with JavaFX instead of the console-based UI.
All functionalities are there same, there are no additional features.

### Project 4 - (RUPizzeria JavaFX)
A GUI-based software that manages the RUPizzeria restaurant. Developed using JavaFX and includes a GUI for the users/staff to interact with.
The restaurant contains different styles and flavors of pizzas with different customizable crusts, toppings and sizes.
Includes features such as
* Customizing an order
* Placing Orders
* Taking Orders
* Canceling Orders
* Keeping track of the order history
* Exporting the order history to a file

### Project 5 - (RUPizzeria Android Studio)
The same GUI-based software that manages the RUPizzeria restaurant from Project 4 but ported to an Android Application. All basic functionality
are the same.
Includes additional features speifically for an Android Application such as Activities, Custom Classes for UI elements, and EventHandlers.
